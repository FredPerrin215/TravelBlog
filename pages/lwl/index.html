      The meaning behind the name of this blog comes from a song that I found myself frequently listening to on the road. Long White Line by Sturgill Simpson is a classic road trip song about the never ending quest to find yourself in your travels and that really resonated with me. There is plenty of time to reflect on the past and wonder about the future while on the road and I did plenty of that myself. Whether on long travel days or in the depths of some of my destinations, that long white line is in my mind and the continuous push to find and better myself was a constant theme throughout all of my travels. Aligning goals, finding passions, and searching for inner peace is something that comes with traveling and especially when embarking on road trips like the ones I have taken. To me, the long white line symbolizes an internal finish line one can never cross. Chasing this long white is something that can only produce positive results and the journey towards that line is one of self growth and understanding. The song is one of many that I regularly listened to on the road and throughout my travels but it was one that has always stuck out to me. Give it a listen yourself and experience Sturgill's quest towards that long white line.
