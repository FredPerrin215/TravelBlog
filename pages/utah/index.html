      <p> <strong>2022 </strong>This Utah trip was planned and booked soon after the lengthy Colorado trip I had been on the summer prior. I was ready to ski the best conditions in the United States and immerse myself in Salt Lake City for an entire month. I had always been curious about Salt Lake City and it had always been a spot that I considered moving to. The proximity to the mountains/ski areas, to the diverse landscapes within a few hours drive, I needed to check it out for myself. I was planning on ripping through the midwest as fast as possible but again, I knew I needed to call an audible. I decided on a whim to leave a day early and head south towards Arizona to see the grand canyon. That took me through an entire section of the country I had never previously seen. Calling audubles is something I have grown to love as they typically end up going well. I was able to see the southwest and actually grow to really enjoy the desert much more than I thought I ever would have. On the way to the Grand Canyon I was able to also see Albuqurque, New Mexico and cross another state off in the process. As I drove closer to the Grand Canyon, the landscape in Northern Arizona started to become more and more desert like and as my anticipation built, I had finally arrived at the south rim of the park. The enormity of the Grand Canyon blew me away and the silence that fell as the winds would die down was something I had never experienced. I spent a fair amount of time at the park taking in the sights but it was time to head to my hotel in Page, Arizona right next to Lake Powell.</p>

      <p> I had grew quite fond of the desert and its extreme contrast to what I was used to living on the east coast. Page is a small town adjacent to Lake Powell which provides most of the town with its economic stimulus so being there in the off season gave me a unique look at it. With local residents making up most of the population at the time, I got to see who actually makes this place run successfully during it's peak time. After authentic mexican cuisine it was time to head to bed to get some rest for my final day of travel. Driving north through the entire state of Utah the following day allowed me to see the amount of varying landscapes that make up the beehive state. From both low and high deserts to extreme mountain ranges I got to see what I felt like was Utah in it's entirety which I was really thankful for. By the time I got to Salt Lake City, I had felt like I already had been on a trip for four days due to all of the new things I had experienced on the way out there. I was eager to get settled in and after unpacking, I was set on hitting the mountains. I had a ski pass that gave me access to two resorts, Snowbasin in Huntsville and Park City, so with limited options I decided to check out Snowbasin for my first time skiing in the Wasatch Mountains. The conditions were awesome my first time out and I had high hopes for what was in store for the month I would be there. Unfortunately those conditions were some of the best I had skiied on the entire trip as the entire western portion of the United States was in a high pressure system that prevents snowfall. This did not deter me from skiing just about every day I could as I frequently found myself in Park City exploring the massive resort. I was lucky enough to ski Alta a few weeks into my trip which broke up my normal routine of Park City and it produced the best conditions but were mediocore to locals who were used to the champagne powder that Utah is famous for.</p> 
      <p> Regardless of conditions, I was able to share my time in the Wasatch Mountains with my dad and two friends who each flew out to ski and see the city. My dad had scheduled a quick trip out to see me and to ski Alta as he had never skiied much outside of the Pocono Mountains in eastern Pennsylvania. He was in awe of the magnitude of western resorts and the snow quality throughout the mountain which is nonexistent back east. It was really rewarding to see him enjoy what Utah had to offer in terms of skiing and taking him to the best of the best was definietly worth it. While his time in Utah was short it was really cool to share the experience with him and I was glad he could step away from work for a couple days and get a break from his busy schedule. </p>
      
      <p> The next week I was expecting two more travellers to fly in to see the city and get some skiing in. The first of my friends arrived and it was good to see him as I haven't seen him for at least a few months. We were planning on going to Snowbird, a popular resort in famous Little Cottonwood Canyon, for a day of skiing. After a nights rest, it was time to head for the mountains. Once we got situated on the mountian, we beelined for Mineral Basin, a bowl on the backside of Snowbird that allows for some ungroomed turns in a unique environment. 
      </p>
      <p> Our time at Snowbird was nothing short of spectacular and we skiied open to close leaving us exhausted but accomplished. That night we made our way to the airport to pick up another one of our friends who was flying in to see Salt Lake City and get some hiking in. Once picked up, we spent hours catching up at my apartment and once drowsiness set in, we headed to bed. The next day was filled with rock climbing at a popular rock gym in the area and exploring the city while laughing along the way. As the day drew to an end it was time for one of them to make their departure. After dropping him off at the airport and heading back for some rest, we had planned to find a hike to do with the remaining friend's time in Salt Lake City. Once we found a hike, we set off to explore the Wasatch on foot. This was something I have not done yet and while somewhat difficult due to the ice on the trail and our lack of hiking spikes, we still made the most of it. We capped off the adventure with In n Out burgers and headed back to the apartment for some dinner. After dinner we headed back to the airport and once again I was on my own in Salt Lake City with not much time until I headed back home.

      <p> With my departure creeping closer, I had begin to map out my route home. I had began to realize that I should take full advantage of my ski pass, which gave me access to most resorts in Summit County, Colorado, and take i-70 into the Rockies with a pitstop at Vail. I had eventually scrapped the idea and opted for the more direct route home but once again I called an audible. While in the car ready to drive home, I decided to drive to Vail and take full advantage of the opportunity I had. Vail was a place I had always dreamt of skiing and after six hours of driving, I had made arrived for a quick afternoon ski. Once on the mountain I immediately navigated to the back bowls. The back bowls are an extensive section of terrain on the back side of Vail which offers some of the best skiing in Colorado. While my time there was short, I was really glad I decided to drive there. I had really enjoyed Vail and plan to return back someday. 
      </p> 
      <p> The rest of the way home was largely uneventful as I really just wanted to put the midwest behind me and get home. Once I was home and yet another trip was in the books I had a real sense of peace looking back at the memories made during not only this trip but every tripo prior. It was really rewarding to share such memorable experiences with people that you are really close with and it is motivating to continue to work towards making these trips more frequent.  </p>
