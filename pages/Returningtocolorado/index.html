      <p><strong>2021 </strong>After a year of planning, I was finally able to make the haul out west again. This time, I would be picking up my dad at Denver International Airport and get to witness him experience the rockies for the frist time. This was a transformative experience that allowed my dad to see what the west had to offer. In a way I was able to relive my first trip by seeing my dad so extatic as this was all new to him. Our first stop was in Rocky Mountain National Park in Estes Park. Prior to arriving in Estes, we made a pitstop in Boulder to show my dad a Colorado Staple town. After a quick bite to eat we headed north towards Estes Park to explore RMNP. Upon checking into our hotel, we had decided to drive Trail Ridge Road. This weaved us through varying terrain and showcased unparalleled views of the park. After many pitstops and photos, we reached the Alpine Visitors Center where we would turned back for Estes and head into town for dinner. My dad was overwhelmed with the scenic views and the enormity of the park so our out and back trip was a success to me. The next morning we were preparing to drive the length of the park and head further into the rockies to continue our journey. We took an alternate route to the Alpine Visitors Center which offered views that were new to both of us which was cool to experience together. On our way out we actually spotted a moose grazing by the road and it was our first time seeing the second largest ungulate in North America. After a long day of driving and taking in the full extent of the park, we had reached our next destination, Winter Park, Colorado. This small mountain town served as a bridge to where the bulk of our trip would be spent.</p>

      <p> Winter Park is a small town with not much going on in the summer months as it is primarily a ski town, however we did find some of the best food of the trip. Fraser Valley Distilling provided us with exceptional southern style table fare that put us hungry travelers at ease. The following day we made our way through the mountains and arrived in the town of Silverthorne for an afternoon of horseback riding. We booked an outing at a private ranch and after an hour ride with scenic views of Silverthorne, it was time for us to check into our Airbnb in Frisco. The town of Frisco is a small mountain town that is well populated year round. After dinner in town we settled in for the night and got some much needed rest. The following day we set out to explore some of Summit County's most famous features. We visited Vail and walked around the base of the resort in awe of the infrastructure built for the iconic ski resort. Soon after we drove into the national forest to hike around Vail Pass. We chose a moderate hike with panoramic views at the top and even walked through what seemed like miles of wildflower meadows.</p>

      <p> The afternoon hike was an amazing experience as we got to share the beauty of the Rockies on foot instead of by car. The isolated nature of hiking allowed us to fully immerse ourselves in the enviornment and take it all in as we both knew this was a special experience we would never forget. The next day we explored Breckenridge and were even able to take the lift up to the top to see views from the top of the resort. We then headed into the mountains via Boreas Pass to check old old mining towns. With Frisco as the base for our trip, we headed back for our final day in Frisco.

      <p> After a full breakfast, we were ready to drive back to the edge of the front range and see the town of Golden, the home of Coors Brewing. Golden is a small town with rich history and it didn't take long for us enjoy what the town had to offer. We took a quick pit stop at a brewery and finalized our time there by cruising by the brewery to see where the famous beer is made. We then headed into Denver to check into our hotel.

      <p> After close to a week of winding through the front range with my dad, it was time for him to go and as his flight loomed closer, I began to realize that I needed to call an audible. Origionally I had planned to spend a week by myself in the rockies to fish, hike, and visit friends that live in Denver. Upon checking the weather it was evident that most of the time would be spent cooped up in the truck avoiding rain. I realized the smartest thing to do would be to buy a ticket home and fly back with my dad. Once home I would spend the next four days working and researching camp spots for when I would make my return. After flying back and getting back to my truck, I immediately high-tailed it to the mountains. I arrived in Montezuma, CO and found an isolated spot relatively quickly. I woke up to an amazing view with a stream flowing not too far from the truck. After spending the morning fishing, I decided to head into town for some lunch.</p>

      <p> This is when I got in contact with a friend that lives in Denver and arranged to camp in Idaho Springs. As the sun began to set I found myself in a familiar spot, a campspot that provided great views with no other campspots for miles. This allowed complete seclusion and an opportunity to embrace what the Rocky Mountains without interuption.</p2>
  
      <p2> After a night of catching up with and old friend, we went our separate ways and I began to prep the truck for more travellers. Three of my good friends were flying to Denver and an entirely different trip was about to begin. After camping out in the mountains one last time I began my journey back to DIA early in the morning of their arrival. After picking them up, sharing some laughs over fried chicken, and meeting up with another good friend, we began our journey to Moab ,UT. This 6 hour drive turned into roughly 8 hours as we were rerouted around a portion of i-70 that had experienced a massive rockslide. This left the already weary travellers in a delierious state that was nothing short of comical. After stopping for dinner we began to make the final push into the desert. We arrived at night and were convinced we were in some sort of valley. After watching shooting stars and unwinding after a criminally long travel day, we headed to bed. Upon waking up, we soon realized that we were not in fact in a valley, we were in the middle of the desert in the flattest possible spot. The laughs we shared that morning carried into the rest of the trip and we wound up in Durango, CO for the remainder of the trip. Sharing memories with good company in such spectacular places is truly what life is all about. 
      </p2>
<p>Before heading south to Durango, we visited Arches National Park just north of Moab, Utah. These strange geologic features were fun to see and climbing through some of the arches with everyone set a great tone for the rest of the trip. 
</p>
<p> While in Durango, we stayed at our friends Aunt's house that had everything we needed to make this as comfortable as possible while still camping. The backyard was huge and the back of the property bordered a stretch of woods that ended at an overlook of the town of Durango. We set up camp in those woods directly behind a firepit at the edge of the property and we would spend our nights by the fire reminiscing about the days events. On the property there was an outdoor shower that allowed us to wash up after days of hiking in the San Juan Mountains. The town of Durango was completely different from any town along the front range as it had a very relaxed, home like aptmosphere as most of the people in Durango were residents and not tourists. This was a much needed change of pace for me which I had not known I even needed. We spent the next few days hiking in and around Durango as well as in the San Juan Mountains as we hiked in Engineer Pass, a popular spot in Southwest Colorado.

<p> We spent the last day of the trip driving the Million Dollar Highway through the towns of Silverton and Ouray. These mountain towns were ringed in by some of the most extreme terrain I have ever seen. After a stop at a brewery in Ouray, it was time for us to part ways with our friend who lived in Colorado and for the remaining four of us to head east. We began our journey back home and out of the Rockies with a familiar pitstop along the way. We made it out of Colorado that night and spent the night in a hotel in western Kansas. Our second travel day ended in Columbia Missouri. After checking out of our hotel in Columbia, it was time to head to Nashville, a city I stopped in on my first trip out west. We met up with our friends friend and boyfriend who we would spend the entire night with. Music City treated us well and we made the most of our short time there. The next morning we prepared to make the final trek home and the nearly 15 hour drive was one of the longest I had ever been on. The memories made on this trip were unlike any I had from trips prior and I really appreciated with experiences with my good friends in places we may never see again.
