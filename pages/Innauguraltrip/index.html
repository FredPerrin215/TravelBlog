      <p> <strong>2020 </strong>The maiden voyage was one that will forever be engrained in my memory. It laid the ground work to what would be numerous returns to the western front. The culmination of trekking accross the midwest to the complete unknown of what waited ahead, stepping into the unknown was what excited me the most. The entire trip was filled with firsts as I had never been as west as Harrisburg prior.</p> 
      <p>I had recently purchased a Toyota Tacoma with the intentions of taking it on trips and even camping out of it when need be. This required me to purchase a truck cap and deck out the inside of it with storage as well as a sleeping platform. After drafting up a few ideas and a handful of trips to Home Depot, I had myself a truck camper. I was eager to hit the road and put the setup to the test in places I had previously only imagined of traveling to.</p>
      <p> Chicago was the first destination and with no expectations, I was ready to explore the windy city. After a twelve hour drive, pulling into the city and driving down Lake Shore Drive, I immediately was impressed with the enormity of Chicago. My hotel was downtown on the Chicago River and with the amount of nature I was about to experience, I realized how much I needed to enjoy the moment I was living in. After dinner I was more then ready to hit the hay as I had just emnarked on the longest drive of my life at the time. Upon waking up the next morning, the reality that I was about to drive an equal distance had set in.</p>
      <p> A cool part about this trip is that everywhere I went was new to me, including the midwestern portion of the trip. The second day of traveling took me through Wisconsin, Minnesota, and South Dakota. Even these relatively mundane portions of the country allowed me to appreciate the middle ground that separated me from the main points of the trip. The second day was arguably longer than the first as I settled into the road trip. This would be my first night camping in the truck and the spot I chose to set up shop for the night was outside the Badlands National Park in Wall, SD. As dusk was setting in I arrived at the site after exploring the National Park more then ready to call it a night. The campsite was a well known spot with lots of RVs, campers, and even motorcycles as the Sturgis Motercycle Rally was going on at the time. The site ran along a cliff that provided scenic views of western South Dakota.</p>
      <p> As nightfall ensued, a thunderstorm rolled in and at times the lightning would light up the entire landscape and the thunder would echo through the canyons below. This was an unexpected surprise and I took some time during the night to experience what I probably never will again. It was easily one of the coolest and most bizzare events I have ever been a part of while camping.

      <p> I spent the next morning sipping coffee at sunrise and watching Bighorn sheep make their way out of the canyons and into our site. This was my first time seeing these animals and their size, strength, as well as their ability to scale rockfaces amazed me and I found myself not wanting to leave. Once the morning heat began to set in I realized it was time to go and make my way to Montana, a place that I had been keen on exploring for some time now.
      </p>
     <p> Making the push into Montana allowed me to see western South Dakota and even the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally. The beauty of the Black Hills was something I had not anticipated but it is a place that I definietly need to go back and explore in depth at some point. After a full day of driving, I had finally began to see what southwestern Montana had to offer. The large mountain ranges and vast wilderness immediately boosted my morale and once I arrived in Bozeman, I was sold. The town of Bozeman was full of life and the people were very welcoming. This was something I was not used to living in suburban Philadelphia. After checking into the airbnb and getting some rest it was time to hike. The hike I chose was moderately long and I wanted to get to the trailhead relatively early. Pulling into the trailhead I was the only car in the lot and being my first time in Grizzly country, this was a bit alarming. With my bag packed and bear spray by my side, I was ready to get going. The hike took sround two hours and with sweeping views of the mountains along the way, I found myself constantly stopping for pictures. At one of my stops I came across a note on a tree from a hiker the previous day warning other hikers that they had seen a bear on the trail around the same time I was there. I immediately became wary and more aware of my surroundings as I began to hike through a heavily wooded section of the trail. After a bearless walk through the woods I began making my way to the top. I was greeted with some of the most impressive views I had ever seen at the time. I was in awe of what I was witnessing and I did not want to leave the top of that mountain. I knew at some point I had to get back to the truck because I had more on my agenda that day.</p>

     <p>I had scheduled a horseback riding trip that afternoon so I could not stay as long as I wanted but I knew that I needed to make the most out of my time there. After getting back to the truck and grabbing some lunch, I headed to a ranch in the natoinal forest surrounding Bozeman. I had never gone horseback riding but the outfitter I chose, Jakes Horses, made it an enjoyable experience that I will never forget.</P> 

<p> I only had one full day planned in Montana but with so much to see, it is a place I absolutely have to return to.       </p>
      
      <p> After reluctantly packing up in Bozeman, the next stop would be where I would spend the bulk of my trip: Wyoming. I had set off to Yellowstone National Park to see what the oldest and largest National Park was all about. The enormity of the park actually became a nuisance as each attraction was at least over an hour from eachother. Overall the park was underwhelming but that was not the main focus of my time in the Cowboy State. Two hours south of Yellowstone is the Grand Tetons and Jackson Hole. This is where I would spend the majority of my time on this road trip. The Tetons region was a place that I found solace in and I fell in love with the entire area. I spent my days exploring the National Park and my evenings finding campspots with views of the iconic mountains. I had hiked to a glacial lake within the Teton Range and the teal water nestled in the mountain was something I had never seen before. </p>

<p>The town of Jackson is nestled in the foothills outside of the Tetons and while rather quaint, it provided the necessary amount of modernity I needed while spending most of my time in the wilderness away from modern amenities. Between the unparralleled views, unforgiving hikes, and historic mountain town feel, that entire region is one that will hold a very special place in my heart.  
        </p>

<p> As my time in Wyoming came to an end, the final stop in my western road trip was about to begin. I had plans to explore the Front Range in Colorado for a couple days and with a jam packed itinerary, there was a lot to see in my short time there. The first stop was in Estes Park to visit Rocky Mountain National Park. RMNP boasted austounding views and was extremely accessible with roadways providing some of the best views in the park. I did get to hike to Emerald lake which was very cool and waking up to hike it for sunrise was also a great idea. I also almost hit an elk driving to the trailhead which woke me up from the pre-coffee haze I was in. After exploring the park I then headed down to Boulder, Colorado to check out the town and then headed back into the mountains to set up camp for the night. I found myself in the national forest around Nederland, Colorado where I spent my first night camping in the Centennial State. The following day I made my way south to Colorado Springs where I had plans on seeing the Garden of The Gods park as well as Pikes Peak, the highest point in Colorado. Colorado Springs is where I said goodbye to the rockies and began my drive back east.  
</p>
<p> With the Rocky Mountains fresh in my mind, it was hard to imagine enjoying the more mellow mountians back east but there was one last mountainous stop before returning home. I had booked a hotel in the Smoky Mountains in North Carolina outside Asheville. I had never been before but the Smoky Mountains were always on my short list of places to see. To break up the drive I figured it would be a great place to cap off the trip. Before arriving in the Smokies, there was another stop I had planned to break up the monotony of driving: Nashville Tennesee. This was another place on my short list and I figured this would be the perfect time to see what the Music City is all about. After a fun night in Nashville it was time to head into the Smokies for my last hurrah in the mountains before I head home. The Smokies are unlike other mountains in the Appalacian Range and I grew a deep appreciation for them. I only spent one night there but that is a place I will certainly spend more time exploring in the future. </p>

      <p> With the complete overload of new scenery, I found myself overwhelmed with the amount of possibilities that presented themselves in these new places. From the initial taste of western landscape in South Dakota, to Bozeman and the rugged mountains that surround it, to the Tetons that provided me with some of the best experiences of my life, to the front range in Colorado that showed me how the west truly lives, I returned home with nothing but visions on returning back to those mountains. </p>
