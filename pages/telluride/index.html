      <p> <strong> 2021 </strong>After two successful trips during the summer months, it was time to head west to ski. This time, I would be leaving my truck behind and taking a good friends truck to Telluride, Colorado to get a taste of some of the best skiing conditions the west has to offer. After months of planning and constant excitement, we finally embarked on what would be a first for two seasoned road trip veterans. Midway on our trek into the San Juan Mountains, we stopped in Kansas City for some of the best barbeque I have ever had. This blew my previous experiences with Kansas City away and I had instantly changed my tune on a city I had previously been quite hard on. As we arrived the next day in Colorado Springs we had made a sobering discovery. We were under the impression that the entire mountain was open and upon checking on current conditions, we discovered that only 19 our of 145 trails were open. That initially set us back a bit but as the dust settled we were then able to laugh at our situation and our own stupidity. This was a staple for our trip as we laughed the entire way there and back.</p> 
      
      <p>
        The town of Telluride is the most breathtaking town I have ever been in as it is nestled in a valley surrounded by enormous mountains on all sides and borders Telluride Ski Resort on its western half. Our Airbnb was at the furthest most point from the gondola in town so getting on the hill every morning began with a stiff twenty minute walk on frozen concrete in ski boots which provided a nice workout as well as many laughs along the way. While our exposure on the mountain was limited, what we did get to experience was some of the best conditions I have ever had the pleasure of skiing. Our second day there it snowed the entire morning and mid afternoon which gave us fresh snow as well as awesome scenery throughout the day.</p>

        <p> The mountain was seldom crowded as it is quite difficult to get to if you are not driving or landing on their one strip airport in a private jet as it is 5 hours from the nearest international airport. The lack of crowds paired with prime conditions gave way for a spectacular three days and we took full advantage by being on the mountain as much as possible. After each day on the hill we would go out for dinner and by doing that we met some interesting characters that make up this exclusive mountain town. The people that live and work in that town were some fascinating people and their perspectives on things both big and small were incredibly interesting to delve into. The people we met would fuel many converstions that would carry into the next day as we were bound to see them again.</p>

   <p> On our final day a new section of mountain opened which had more expert terrain which is what we were after. We spent that morning on the new terrain and as our legs began to give out we decided it was time to begin our journey back east. We left Telluride around noon on that third day and made our way to our first midwest destination: North Platte, Nebraska. 
  </p>
      <p> Nebraska is by no means an interesting place, but we tried to make the most out of it since we had both never been before so we scheduled a stop in Lincoln for lunch. After getting some lunch we decided to eat outside the University of Nebraska football stadium. As we were finishing up I caught a glimse of a truck driving into the stadium. I noticed that as some time passed the gate never closed so I grew curious and decided to take a walk over there to see if we could get a look at the field. We walked over and then proceeded to walk through the open gate and were greeted by what seemed to be someone affiliated with the football team. He stopped us and told us the stadium was closed so we explained that we were from out of town and just wanted to see the field. He paused for a moment and then waived us through. We found ourselves standing on one of the endzones on the field is dismay. This was such a funny moment as we had absolutely no plans on even getting in, let alone get onto the field. The stadium was impressive but our dumb luck was even more impressive and we laughed about it all the way to our next stop: St. Louis, Missouri.

      <p> After a long day of driving, I was a bit strung out from the road. I had not anticipated us to get into anything more exciting then a good dinner and a good nights rest. We decided after dinner to head out and see what St. Louis was all about. Upon doing so we met two local characters that served as our tour guides for the night. They spent most of the night talking up the city and its positive qualities. They showed us local spots and the night turned out to be exactly the opposite of my expectations. This was much needed as we had both been a bit hellbent on getting home and not really stopping to appreciate the parts of the country we were seeing. After a long night we woke up to many laughs about the night before and began our jounrey to our next stop in rural Pennsylvania to see my friend's good friend from college. This required a lengthy haul across the midwest and we were both ready to put in the miles to get there. We arrived at the house late that night and were met by a welcoming family that graciously opened up their home to us. We had a relatively short drive home from there and once again another memorable trip was concluded.
